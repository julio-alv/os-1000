The operating system contais a basic scheduler, file system and shell

here are the programs that you can run:

```sh
hello # prints "hello from the shell!"
exit # closes the process
readfile # reads from the file system (from hello.txt)
writefile # writes a file into the file system (should be visible if you uncompress the resulting .tar)
```
